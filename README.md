### Kitty On Non-NixOS Systems

OpenGL in Nix is broken on non-NixOS system,
and solutions like the NixGL wrapper are not fully integrated yet.

Until then, simply use the official kitty installer:

<https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/>

Or download the binary bundle:

<https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/releases>


Kitty will then be installed twice,
and in the terminal the nixos version will be in the PATH,
which can't start a GUI, but runs otherwise.

Make sure to hook up the absolute path of the other kitty install with DE/WM keymaps.

Also make sure that the versions match, so the configuration doesn't get messed up

## on NixOS

make sure that the nixpkgs versions in `nix/sources.json` match with the NixOS version

```sh
make nixos-switch
```
